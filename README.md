# Hashing

The built-in function hash() in Python returns an object's hash value if it has one.
When looking at a dictionary, the hash value—an integer—is used to easily compare dictionary keys.
Features of the hash() function

Hash() operations on objects are irreversible and result in information loss.
Hash() can be used to check for mutable or immutable objects because it only returns hashed values for immutable objects.
